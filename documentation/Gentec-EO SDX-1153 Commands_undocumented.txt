Hi Tom,

#NOTE Explains manual gain on output port, several commands, and start up.
Yes, the SDX1153 puts the gain on the comport when you change the gain manually. I did this for debug 
purposes and I left it active.

The DAT command forces a new conversion from the ADC and sends it to the com port.

The commands not in the manual are:

MFG is a command or a query. If sent with no argument, it returns the stored manufacture date. If sent 
with a command, a string up to 20 characters long, the new value is stored in Flash.

The following three commands are all performed at power up.

CAL forces a self-calibration of the current offset DAC
RST forces a reset of the current offset DAC
INI forces an initialization of the current offset DAC

So the useful one may be the manufacture date as it will allow you to store up to 20 character in Flash, 
the same as the SNM command. 

Thanks,

Sid

Hi Sid,

I have been writing a LabVIEW driver for the SDX-1153 and I hope I can ask you to answer a few more 
questions.

1) When manually changing the gain, the SDX-1153 seems to send the new gain automatically (e.g., 
10Momh range) if the program has an open VISA communication to the SDX-1153. Am I understanding 
the operation correctly?
2) When operating the SDX-1153 as a laser power meter without an external DVM, is the DAC command 
the typical way to read the current from the photodiode?
3) Are there any other commands like the SNM not listed in the documentation, like a Reset or Self-
Test?

Thanks, 
Tom Larason

Sid,

Thanks a lot for your quick answers. The SNM command is great. With it being stored in flash we could 
use it to store the serial number and maybe the calibration date. I guess it's an undocumented feature 
which only gets me wondering what other wonderful features you guys have built in. Thanks again.

Hi Tom,

1.	Yes, it will only communicate with one instrument at a time.
2.	Yes you will.
#NOTE Explains the IDN command returns only model # and use SNM to store unique id (like SN).
3.	IDN returns the model. You can use SNM<20 character string> to set an unique identifier. This 
will allow you to have software identify which device it is talking to. The unique string is stored 
in flash so it is persistent until you change it.

Thanks,

Sid

Sid,

Three of more quick questions.

1)	We were planning on controlling several of the amplifiers (4-5) at a time with one computer. 
The software that came with the amplifiers will only work with one amp connected to the 
computer at a time. Am I correct?

2)	I tried connecting two up and the program would automatically connect to one of the two amps 
and I could not select with of the two was selected. So it appears we will have to write our own 
software to control multiple amplifiers. Right?

3)	The IDN query only returns the model number and not the serial number. Correct?

Thanks, 
Tom Larason

Hi Sid,

Opps, my fault. The SDX-1153 program is there. I overlooked it both in the Start menu and on the 
Program Files folder. Two strikes for me. Thanks for your help.

Hi Tom,

#NOTE Explains how SDX installer works.
Two installs are done, one for the SDX-1153 software, and one for VISA. The software installer tries to 
load VISA in case it is not already on the host PC. This message is letting you know it doesn't need to 
load. The actual SDX-1153 software should have installed. If it is already on the host PC, it will not install. 
The behavior you are seeing is what happens when the SDX software is already on the PC and the VISA 
version is on the PC an is newer. Are you sure the SDX-1153 software is not already on the PC? 

If it is not I can try and make you an installer that does not load VISA, but this really should work as is 
unless the installer is corrupted on the CD.

Let me know,

Sid

Don,

I ran into a problem trying to install the software for the new SDX-1153 amplifiers. The computer I'm 
using already has LabVIEW installed and I get the following message during installation, so it seems that 
the only choice is to cancel the installation. Any suggestions?
 

Also there are two installer.exe files on the CD-ROM. Not sure which one to use, but they seem to be the 
same. Both has the same results listed above.
 


Thanks, 
Tom Larason
