From the SDX-1153 User Manual v2.1, 1.6.2 SDX-1153 Serial Commands:
 
All commands and replies are followed by a carriage return (0x0D) and a line feed
(0x0A). Unless otherwise noted, if a command is used with no arguments it will become
a query. All commands are case insensitive.
 
All commands reply with:
OK if the command executed correctly.
ERR if the command could not be executed.
All Queries reply with the item that was queried or ERR if the query could not be executed.
